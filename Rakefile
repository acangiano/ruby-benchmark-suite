# This Rakefile is included so you can run RBS Benchmarks
# See the readme for examples
#
# NOTE: rakelib/bench.rake requires this directory to be named: benchmark
#       you may want to modify bench.rake to suit your own defaults.
# 	If you want to run a different implementation set the environment
# 	variable VM to point to a ruby executable, or change this line in
# 	rakelib/bench.rake
# 	VM              = ENV['VM'] || "ruby"
#
#       other environment variables: ITERATIONS (default 5), TIMEOUT (300)
