pty extension version 0.3 by A.ito

1. Introduction

This extension module adds ruby a functionality to execute an 
arbitrary command through pseudo tty (pty).

2. Install

Follow the instruction below.

(1) Execute

      ruby extconf.rb

    then Makefile is generated.

(3) Do make; make install.

3. What you can do

This extension module defines a module named PTY, which contains
following module fungtions:

   getpty(command)
   spawn(command)

      This function reserves a pty, executes command over the pty 
      and returns an array. The return value is an array with three
      elements. The first element in the array is for reading and the 
      second for writing. The third element is the process ID of the
      child process. If this function is called with an iterator block,
      the array is passed to the block as block parameters, and the
      function itself returns nil.

      When the child process is suspended or finished, an exception is
      raised.  If this function is called with an iterator block,
      exception is raised only within the block.  Child process
      monitor is terminated on block exit.

   protect_signal
   reset_signal

      These functions are obsolete in this version of pty.
