To run these, you might need to install a gem:

Linux MRI/rubinius:
 sqlite3 
 (via $gem install sqlite3
  or you can cd into sqlite3-1.3.3.install_from_here_from_src_via_setup and run ruby setup.rb to install it via non-gem, locally)

jruby any platform:
 none required

MRI 1.8/1.9 on windows:
 none required

IronRuby on windows:
 none required

Note that you also need to install rake (as a gem), though it's typically they're installed by default on the various VM's.

To check if they're working, do a verbose run, like
$ rake bench:file FILE=benchmarks/rails/bm_substruct_test_all.rb ITERATIONS=1 VERBOSE=1  

To make sure it's working well.

Note that this message:

Problems loading MiniMagickProcessor: no such file to load -- mini_magick

is expected (and a few rails unit tests fail).
