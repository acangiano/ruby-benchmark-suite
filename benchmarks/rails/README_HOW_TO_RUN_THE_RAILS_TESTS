To run these, you need to install rubygems in each VM(a copy is in dependencies/rubygems-1.7.2.tgs), and you might need to also install a gem 
(which may require you to also install the sqlite3-devel headers on your platform):

Linux MRI/rubinius:
 install the sqlite3 gem
  via 
  $ gem install dependencies/sqlite-1.3.3.gem  # bundled copy of the sqlite3-1.3.3 gem
  or just 
  $ gem install sqlite3

jruby any platform:
 none required

MRI 1.8/1.9 on windows:
 none required

IronRuby on windows:
 none required

You'll also need to have installed the openssl extension when your ruby VM was initially compiled (most do).

To check if rails tests are now functional, do a "verbose" run, like

$ rake bench:file FILE=benchmarks/rails/bm_substruct_test_all.rb ITERATIONS=1 VERBOSE=1  

To make sure it's working.

Note that this message:

Problems loading MiniMagickProcessor: no such file to load -- mini_magick

is expected (and a few rails unit tests fail).
