To run these, you might need to install a gem:

Linux MRI/rubinius:
 sqlite3-ruby gem install

jruby any platform:
 none required

MRI 1.8/1.9 on windows:
 none required

IronRuby on windows:
 none required

Note that you might also need to install rake (gem), and the builder gem, though it seems VM dependent somehow, and 
typically they're installed by default on each VM.

To check if they're working, do a verbose run, like
$ rake bench:file FILE=benchmarks/rails/bm_substruct_test_all.rb ITERATIONS=1 VERBOSE=1  

To make sure it's working well.

Note that this message:

Problems loading MiniMagickProcessor: no such file to load -- mini_magick

is expected (and a few rails unit tests fail).
