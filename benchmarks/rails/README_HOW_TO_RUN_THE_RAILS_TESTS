To run these, you'll need:

Linux MRI, rubinius:
 sqlite3-ruby gem install

jruby:
 none required

mingw MRI on windows:
 none required

Note that you might have to install rake, and the builder gem, though it seems VM dependent somehow, and typically they're installed by default for your VM.

To check if they're working, do a verbose run, like
$ rake bench:file FILE=benchmarks/rails/bm_substruct_test_all.rb ITERATIONS=1 VERBOSE=1  

To make sure they're working well.
