      links.

Updated:
  1. Upgrade to Rails 2.1.0
  2. Full coverage of tests, unit and functional

Upgrade steps:
  !!! NOTES - IMPORTANT TO READ
  The application_helper function "make_product" has gone away, so if you've
  customized the _product.rhtml partial you'll need to take a look
  at the one now included with the base distro. See issue here:
  http://code.google.com/p/substruct/issues/detail?id=117
  
  ***
  The 'Cart' model has completely gone away. This could affect you
  if you've extended it in any way. Please see the following for details:
  http://code.google.com/p/substruct/issues/detail?id=114
  
  ***
  A new layout called 'checkout' has been added and now is the default
  renderer for all checkout actions in the store. This ensures that
  a customer can't modify their cart while ordering, thus potentially throwing
  off their order total they see on screen.

  0. Back up your database just in case.
    * mysql example:  mysqldump -u USERNAME -p DATABASE_NAME > backup.sql
  1. Install the ezcrypto gem. (gem install ezcrypto)
  2. rake db:migrate:fix_engines_migrations 
  3. script/generate plugin_migration
  4. rake db:migrate
     ...THIS MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE TIME FOR UPGRADES...
     Let it do it's thing, it has to encrypt all stored CC #'s
  5. rake rails:update
     ...This will update your JS, boot, and environment files to Rails 2.1.0
  6. Manually update you environment.rb file to use RAILS_GEM_VERSIOn 2.1.0

Version 0.97
---------------------------------------
*** Special thanks to Luke Ludwig for his contribution of this patch!
*** Visit his blog over @ http://lukeludwig.com/blog

Upgrade steps:
  1. Make sure you have the mini_magick and mime-types gems installed.
    a. sudo gem install mini_magick
    b. sudo gem install mime-types
        * Note: mime-types gem is only needed to upgrade, but is not
          needed after the upgrade is complete.
  2. Back up your database just in case.
    * mysql example:  mysqldump -u USERNAME -p DATABASE_NAME > backup.sql
  3. script/generate plugin_migration
  4. rake db:migrate
    * All of your uploads and images will be copied to a new location.
      Since it is a copy it is non-destructive, leaving the originals
      in their place.
  5. Merge changes from the new environment.rb file in the 
     vendor/plugins/substruct/config directory to the one inside config/.

Added: 
  1. Added nice installer rake task
  2. Upgrade to Rails 2.0.2 / Engines v2
  3. Images and uploads switched from using file_column and rmagick to 
     using attachment_fu and mini_magick.


Version 0.96
---------------------------------------
This is a step in the direction of making the app easier to install and config
for your average user. Some nice UI features have been added, with the major
one being the ability to set config params from the admin UI, and not in
config files!

Upgrade steps:
  1. script/generate plugin_migration
  2. rake db:migrate
  3. Check out the new environment.rb file in the config_stubs directory.
     Since preferences have been added there's new code that auto-sets
     your mail server in there...diff / merge with your current 
     environment.rb file.
  4. !!! SET YOUR PREFS IN THE ADMIN PANEL


Added:
  - Admin UI now can view Customer accounts, and download a CSV 
    file that contains email addresses. Great for exporting to newsletter
    software, etc.
  - Preferences now set via the admin panel. Lots of stuff has changed.
    Lots of preferences have moved from config files to the db:
  -- Auth.net settings
  -- Mail server settings
  -- Store configuration (show confirmation page, use inventory control, etc)

Fixed:
  - Billing / shipping address code refactoring effort.
  -- Associations were a bit strange and hadn't been looked at for a while.
  -- Removed model methods in favor of AR association code
    


Version 0.951
---------------------------------------
Tagging error with a few items on the 0.95 release...maintenance tag.


Version 0.95
---------------------------------------
MAJOR UPGRADE...lots of new features. Do some thorough testing before you 
roll this out if you're upgrading.

Upgrade steps:
  1. script/generate plugin_migration
  2. rake db:migrate
  3. You should diff your application.rb file with application.rb.example
     in config_stubs. New before_filters have been added.
  
Added:
  - Multiple images per product
  -- You can also set a default product image via drag & drop
  - Product variations
  - Product view pages
  - Product discontinuation & quantity checking
  - Tag grouping for products
  - Customer logins
  - Order history
  - Wishlist support
  - Related product support
  - Inventory control now actually works
  -- Products with inventory <= 0 will not show on the public-facing site
  -- Item quantities decremented after a successful order
  - Live shipping rate calculation RIPPED out, replaced with shipping 
    rate table and new preferences UI.
  -- FedEx is a bitch to set up for most people, and this can achieve the same
     damn thing.
  
Changed:
  - ActiveMerchant now supported instead of Payment gem
  - ContentNodeTypes removed in favor of SingleTableInheritance
  -- Blog, Page, and Snippet models added
  - Cart now uses subModal instead of lame DIV at the bottom of the page
  - User interface / design
  -- Admin UI larger to work better on 1024x768 screens minimum

     on OrderAccount and OrderAddress

Version 0.9
---------------------------------------
Upgrade steps:
  1. Update to Engines 1.2.0
  -- This is done for you if you are using externals to load Substruct
  
  2. Upgrade to Rails 1.2.3
  -- This is done for you if you are using externals to load Substruct
  
  3. Change all instances of engines_stylesheet to stylesheet_link_tag with :plugin => 'substruct'
  -- <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'substruct', :plugin => 'substruct' %>
  
  4. Change all instances of engines_javascript to javascript_include_tag with :plugin => 'substruct'
  -- <%= javascript_include_tag 'substruct', :plugin => 'substruct' %>
  
  5. If you have customized the configuration, change to use..
  -- Substruct.my_custom_config = 'value'
    
  6. MERGE the /vendor/plugins/substruct/config_stubs/environment.rb with your /config/environment.rb file
  -- Some configuration changes have been made.
  -- Merge the two and see if you need to make any updates.

Fixed:
  - Now works with Engines 1.2
  - Fixed all Rails 2.0 deprecation warnings
  - Changed the way config settings work to no longer use module

Version 0.81
---------------------------------------
Upgrade steps:
  0. rake db:migrate:engines:substruct

Added:
  - Order confirmation page.
  -- There are now 3 steps to order, but a more clear order summary and total
     is shown before an order is placed.
  - Ability to search orders by email address and notes field on the admin side.
  - NEW ADMIN REPORT: Orders by country.
Fixed:
  - Managing tags for products would throw error if you had no tags.
  - Order addresses were messed up on the admin side.
  -- It was impossible/buggy to create a separate shipping address after
     an order had been created. Fixed...
  - Updating order items from the admin side didn't properly save the product
    cost for that order. Fixed order.rb by adding a before_save method.

Version 0.8
---------------------------------------
Fixed:
  - Made sure questions require title.
  -- This makes sure you can actually click on all questions from the UI (whoops!)
  - DB setup was flawed, see migrations note.

  Migrations Note
  -----
  Loading db from the schema.rb file was seriously fucked, causing problems with duplicate columns and other nonsense. 

  I've relabeled the migrations, adding the initial DB state as 001. Every other migration has been bumped up 1 version.

  Upgraders might have to change your engine_schema_info table....just an alert.

Version 0.75
---------------------------------------
Added:
  - Ability to download orders on admin side in XML and CSV for export
    to other applications like QuickBooks
  
Upgrade steps:
  0. gem install fastercsv
  
Updated:
  - Updated to Rails 1.1.6
  - Updated to Engines 1.1.4
  

Version 0.7
---------------------------------------
Added:
  - Role Based Access Control

Updated:
  - Updated to Rails 1.1.2 - now included in the vendor directory
  - New authority data for FedEx, be sure to reload authority data!
  
Fixed:
  - Content URLs now auto-clean before validation (Ticket #22)
  - Estimation of international FedEx packages.
    - Including the shipping gem as a library now.
  - Bug on new product creation where tags weren't being saved properly.
  - Bug where it was impossible to clear all tags from a product once assigned.
  - Adding multiple items to the cart object. Before it was only adding 1 at a time.

Upgrade steps:
  0. rake rails:update

  1. rake db:migrate:engines:substruct
  
  2. rake load_authority_data
     !!! WARNING !!!
     This could overwrite your admin user! All that's needed is to 
     update the shipping tables, so you could possibly extract those 
     records by themselves and insert by hand.

     Yes, I know it should have probably been a migration...sorry.

  3. Create an application specific application.rb file. 
     (your_rails_dir/app/controllers/application.rb)
     It's contents should look like this:
    
        class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
          include SubstructApplicationController
        end

     This makes sure that everything is loaded properly. Newer versions of
     Rails were causing issues with loading the application controller from
     the engines directory.
  


Version 0.61
---------------------------------------
Updated:
  - New routes.rb file - you need to copy this into your config directory!
  This supports the new store show_by_tags with multiple tags.
  - Changed store/show_by_tags to display friendly URLs
    (Tags are now passed in by name, not ID)
  - Changed AJAX cart to display 1 physical item for each item / quantity in the cart.
    (no more "x2", etc)
  - Broke out some CSS into include files for the cart.

Upgrade steps:
  0. Copy the new routes.rb to your config directory, or merge the changes.

Version 0.6
---------------------------------------
Added:
  - Tagging for products
  - Maintenance of product tags
  - Automatic image thumbnail / small size creation via RMagick

Updated:
  - Better shopping cart experience with AJAX cart
  - Faceted navigation of product categories
  - Fixed bug where product images would auto-delete when updating something else about a product.

Upgrade steps:

  0. Update the source

      tar -xzvf substruct.tar.gz my_rails_app/vendor/plugins/

  1. Update the DB

      rake engine_migrate

  2. Add blank loading html file for modal. This page gets swapped into the modal dialog (as seen when editing tags) when it's not visible.

      touch public/loading.html

  3. Install RMagick

      This is necessary for automatic image resizing of product images
