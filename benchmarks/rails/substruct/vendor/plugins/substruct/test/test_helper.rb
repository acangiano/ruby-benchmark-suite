### Helper methods for test cases ###

def login_as(user)
  @request.session[:user] = users(user).id
end

def login_as_customer(customer)
  @request.session[:customer] = order_users(customer).id
end

# Unfortunately url_for doesn't work as is inside tests, so, a fix.
def url_for(options)

end

### Custom assertions for test cases ####

# Assert that two arrays have the same elements independent of the order.
def assert_same_elements(an_array, another_array)
  assert_equal an_array - another_array, another_array - an_array
end

# Assertion to test layout for controllers
def assert_layout(layout)
  assert_equal "layouts/#{layout}", @response.layout
end


# The assert_working_associations method simply walks through all of the 
# associations on the class and sends the model the name of the association.
# This catch-all ensures that with a single line of code per model, 
# I can invoke all relationships on all of our model tests.
def assert_working_associations(m=nil)
  m ||= self.class.to_s.sub(/Test$/, '').constantize
  @m = m.new
  m.reflect_on_all_associations.each do |assoc|
    assert_nothing_raised("#{assoc.name} caused an error") do
      @m.send(assoc.name, true)
    end
