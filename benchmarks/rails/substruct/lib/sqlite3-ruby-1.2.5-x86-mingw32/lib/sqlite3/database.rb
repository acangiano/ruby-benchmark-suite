module SQLite3

  # The Database class encapsulates a single connection to a SQLite3 database.
  # Its usage is very straightforward:
  #
  #   require 'sqlite3'
  #
  #   SQLite3::Database.new( "data.db" ) do |db|
  #     db.execute( "select * from table" ) do |row|
  #       p row
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # It wraps the lower-level methods provides by the selected driver, and
  # includes the Pragmas module for access to various pragma convenience
  # methods.
  #
  # The Database class provides type translation services as well, by which
  # the SQLite3 data types (which are all represented as strings) may be
  # converted into their corresponding types (as defined in the schemas
  # for their tables). This translation only occurs when querying data from
  # the database--insertions and updates are all still typeless.
  #
  # Furthermore, the Database class has been designed to work well with the
  # ArrayFields module from Ara Howard. If you require the ArrayFields
  # module before performing a query, and if you have not enabled results as
  # hashes, then the results will all be indexible by field name.
