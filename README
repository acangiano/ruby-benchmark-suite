Ruby Benchmark Suite is a set of Ruby benchmarks for testing the various Ruby implementations available (MRI, Yarv, JRuby, Rubinius, IronRuby, MacRuby, Ruby Enterprise Edition, MagLev, etcetera). The aim of this project is for it to become a useful tool for VM implementers and a standard suite of benchmarks for periodical shootouts amongst Ruby implementations.

The ML of the project is located at: http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-benchmark-suite
