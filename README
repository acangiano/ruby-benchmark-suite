The Ruby Benchmark Suite is a benchmark suite for measuring the performance of Ruby implementations, including micro-benchmarks that focus on core Ruby functionalities, as well as macro-benchmarks that represent a variety of real, common workloads. The project is aimed at providing a useful suite for comparing the performance of the available Ruby implementations and, as a positive side effect, to give VM implementers an additional tool to measure and identity performance related issues.

GETTING THE SUITE
=================
To obtain the suite, simply run:

    git clone git://github.com/acangiano/ruby-benchmark-suite.git

RUNNING THE SUITE
=================
Benchmarks are run using rake. Type "rake -T bench" to see options.

Examples:
  rake bench
  rake bench:file FILE=rbs/micro-benchmarks/bm_app_tak.rb
  rake bench:dir DIR=rbs/micro-benchmarks
  rake bench:to_csv
  rake bench:pattern PATTERN=rbs/micro-benchmarks/bm_gc*
  rake VM=/bin/ruby_special ITERATIONS=3 TIMEOUT=5

The :to_csv task creates a .csv spreadsheet of the results. Quite handy for comparing your results over time.

The VM example runs '/bin/ruby_special' as the VM, 3 iterations instead of the default (5)5, 5 second timeout (per script) instead of the default 300s

  
DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
===================
  deprecated_rbs - contains the old, deprecated version of the suite
  rbs            - contains the benchmarks themselves
  utils          - contains the infrastructure necessary to run the benchmarks

See utils/README for more detail.
    
Additional output formatters are welcome. For example, a :to_wiki would be very convenient to place the results directly in Confluence or a similar Wiki software.

NOTES
=====
You'll probably want to copy rakelib/bench.rake and modify some filenames and locations to suit your needs.

If you want to run a different implementation set the environment variable VM to point to a ruby executable or change this line in rakelib/bench.rake:
  VM = ENV['VM'] || "ruby"
