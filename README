This directory contains a copy of Brian Ford's refactoring of the
Ruby Benchmark Suite project as used by the Rubinius project.

Subdirectories:
  rbs   - contains the benchmarks themselves
  utils - contains the infrastructure necessary to run the benchmarks

see utils/README for more detail.

Benchmarks are run using rake. Type "rake -T bench" to see options.

Examples:
  rake bench
  rake bench:file FILE=benchmark/rbs/core-features/bm_app_tak.rb
  rake bench:dir DIR=benchmark/rbs/core-features
  rake bench:to_csv

The :to_csv task creates a .csv spreadsheet of the results. Quite handy
for comparing your results over time.
    
I'd welcome other output formatters. :to_wiki comes to mind so I could put
the results directly in Confluence.

NOTE: You'll probably want to copy rakelib/bench.rake and modify
some filenames and locations to suit your needs.
