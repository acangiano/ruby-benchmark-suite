Files in this directory are automatically generated from your plugins.
They are copied from the 'assets' directories of each plugin into this directory
each time Rails starts (script/server, script/console... and so on).
Any edits you make will NOT persist across the next server restart; instead you
should edit the files within the <plugin_name>/assets/ directory itself.
