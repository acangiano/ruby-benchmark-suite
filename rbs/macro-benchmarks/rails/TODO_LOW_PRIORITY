test with 1.9/jruby to see if it works?

odd test using ab and multiple concurrency :)

could also do more views than just the root [like an index with lots of products {"at least x"}, and many navigation tags]

rails test with very complex logic or a very large page would be a good test

some requests with 'extra' RAM using garbage before the test

add 'read a file 1000x' test. (and write)

There's a few more tests listed on the mailing list that could be included

some simple threaded socket tests
