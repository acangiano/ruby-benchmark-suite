could also do more views than just the root [like an index with lots of products {"at least x"}, and many navigation tags]

test with 1.9/jruby to see if it works?

could use a rails test with rails 2.2 or beyond 

one with very complex logic or a very large page would be a good test

some requests with 'extra' RAM using garbage before the test

add 'read a file 1000x' test.

There's a few more tests listed on the mailing list that could be included
