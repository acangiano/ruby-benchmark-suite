# The Breakpoint library provides the convenience of
# being able to inspect and modify state, diagnose
# bugs all via IRB by simply setting breakpoints in
# your applications by the call of a method.
#
# This library was written and is supported by me,
# Florian Gross. I can be reached at flgr@ccan.de
# and enjoy getting feedback about my libraries.
#
# The whole library (including breakpoint_client.rb
# and binding_of_caller.rb) is licensed under the
# same license that Ruby uses. (Which is currently
# either the GNU General Public License or a custom
# one that allows for commercial usage.) If you for
# some good reason need to use this under another
# license please contact me.

  # This will pop up an interactive ruby session at a
  # pre-defined break point in a Ruby application. In
  # this session you can examine the environment of
  # the break point.
  #
  # You can get a list of variables in the context using
  # local_variables via +local_variables+. You can then
  # examine their values by typing their names.
  #
  # You can have a look at the call stack via +caller+.
  #
  # The source code around the location where the breakpoint
  # was executed can be examined via +source_lines+. Its
  # argument specifies how much lines of context to display.
  # The default amount of context is 5 lines. Note that
  # the call to +source_lines+ can raise an exception when
  # it isn't able to read in the source code.
  #
  # breakpoints can also return a value. They will execute
  # a supplied block for getting a default return value.
  # A custom value can be returned from the session by doing
  # +throw(:debug_return, value)+.
  #
  # You can also give names to break points which will be
  # used in the message that is displayed upon execution 
  # of them.
  #
  # Here's a sample of how breakpoints should be placed:
  #
  #   class Person
  #     def initialize(name, age)
  #       @name, @age = name, age
  #       breakpoint("Person#initialize")
  #     end
  #
  #     attr_reader :age
  #     def name
  #       breakpoint("Person#name") { @name }
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   person = Person.new("Random Person", 23)
  #   puts "Name: #{person.name}"
  #
  # And here is a sample debug session:
  #
  #   Executing break point "Person#initialize" at file.rb:4 in `initialize'
  #   irb(#<Person:0x292fbe8>):001:0> local_variables
  #   => ["name", "age", "_", "__"]
  #   irb(#<Person:0x292fbe8>):002:0> [name, age]
  #   => ["Random Person", 23]
  #   irb(#<Person:0x292fbe8>):003:0> [@name, @age]
  #   => ["Random Person", 23]
  #   irb(#<Person:0x292fbe8>):004:0> self
  #   => #<Person:0x292fbe8 @age=23, @name="Random Person">
  #   irb(#<Person:0x292fbe8>):005:0> @age += 1; self
  #   => #<Person:0x292fbe8 @age=24, @name="Random Person">
  #   irb(#<Person:0x292fbe8>):006:0> exit
  #   Executing break point "Person#name" at file.rb:9 in `name'
  #   irb(#<Person:0x292fbe8>):001:0> throw(:debug_return, "Overriden name")
  #   Name: Overriden name

  # Breakpoint sessions will automatically have a few
  # convenience methods available. See Breakpoint::CommandBundle
  # for a list of them.
  #
  # Breakpoints can also be used remotely over sockets.
  # This is implemented by running part of the IRB session
  # in the application and part of it in a special client.
  # You have to call Breakpoint.activate_drb to enable
  # support for remote breakpoints and then run
  # breakpoint_client.rb which is distributed with this
  # library. See the documentation of Breakpoint.activate_drb
  # for details.

  # Will run Breakpoint in DRb mode. This will spawn a server
  # that can be attached to via the breakpoint-client command
  # whenever a breakpoint is executed. This is useful when you
  # are debugging CGI applications or other applications where
  # you can't access debug sessions via the standard input and
  # output of your application.
  #
  # You can specify an URI where the DRb server will run at.
  # This way you can specify the port the server runs on. The
  # default URI is druby://localhost:42531.
  #
  # Please note that breakpoints will be skipped silently in
  # case the DRb server can not spawned. (This can happen if
  # the port is already used by another instance of your
  # application on CGI or another application.)
  #
  # Also note that by default this will only allow access
  # from localhost. You can however specify a list of
  # allowed hosts or nil (to allow access from everywhere).
  # But that will still not protect you from somebody
  # reading the data as it goes through the net.
  #
  # A good approach for getting security and remote access
  # is setting up an SSH tunnel between the DRb service
  # and the client. This is usually done like this:
  #
  # $ ssh -L20000:127.0.0.1:20000 -R10000:127.0.0.1:10000 example.com
  # (This will connect port 20000 at the client side to port
  # 20000 at the server side, and port 10000 at the server
  # side to port 10000 at the client side.)
  #
  # After that do this on the server side: (the code being debugged)
  # Breakpoint.activate_drb("druby://127.0.0.1:20000", "localhost")
  #
  # And at the client side:
  # ruby breakpoint_client.rb -c druby://127.0.0.1:10000 -s druby://127.0.0.1:20000
  #
  # Running through such a SSH proxy will also let you use 
  # breakpoint.rb in case you are behind a firewall.
  #
  # Detailed information about running DRb through firewalls is
  # available at http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?DrbTutorial
  #
  # == Security considerations
  # Usually you will be fine when using the default druby:// URI and the default
  # access control list. However, if you are sitting on a machine where there are
  # local users that you likely can not trust (this is the case for example on
  # most web hosts which have multiple users sitting on the same physical machine)
  # you will be better off by doing client/server communication through a unix
  # socket. This can be accomplished by calling with a drbunix:/ style URI, e.g.
  # <code>Breakpoint.activate_drb('drbunix:/tmp/breakpoint_server')</code>. This
  # will only work on Unix based platforms.
