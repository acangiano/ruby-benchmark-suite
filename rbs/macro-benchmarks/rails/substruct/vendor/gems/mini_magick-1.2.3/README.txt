== DESCRIPTION:
  
A ruby wrapper for ImageMagick command line.

- Why?

I was using RMagick and loving it, but it was eating up huge amounts of memory. A simple script like this...

Magick::read("image.jpg") do |f|
 f.write("manipulated.jpg")
end

...would use over 100 Megs of Ram. On my local machine this wasn't a problem, but on my hosting server the ruby apps would crash because of their 100 Meg memory limit.

- Solution!

Using MiniMagick the ruby processes memory remains small (it spawns ImageMagick's command line program mogrify which takes up some memory as well, but is much smaller compared to RMagick)


== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:
  
MiniMagick gives you access to all the commandline options ImageMagick has (Found here http://www.imagemagick.org/script/mogrify.php)

== SYNOPSIS:

Want to make a thumbnail from a file...

image = MiniMagick::Image.from_file("input.jpg")
image.resize "100x100"
image.write("output.jpg")

Want to make a thumbnail from a blob...

image = MiniMagick::Image.from_blob(blob)
image.resize "100x100"
image.write("output.jpg")

Need to combine several options?

image = MiniMagick::Image.from_file("input.jpg")
image.combine_options do |c|
  c.sample "50%"
  c.rotate "-90>"
end
image.write("output.jpg")

Want to manipulate an image at its source (You won't have to write it out because the transformations are done on that file)

image = MiniMagick::Image.new("input.jpg")
image.resize "100x100"

Want to get some meta-information out?

image = MiniMagick::Image.from_file("input.jpg")
image[:width] # will get the width (you can also use :height and :format)
image["EXIF:BitsPerSample"] # It also can get all the EXIF tags
image["%m:%f %wx%h"] # Or you can use one of the many options of the format command found here http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#format


== REQUIREMENTS:

You must have ImageMagick installed.

== INSTALL:

If you downloaded the plugin version, just drop the plugin into RAILS_ROOT/plugins/

If you installed this as a gem, then to get it to work add <require "mini_magick"> to RAILS_ROOT/config/environment.rb

If you have just downloaded this files then copy the mini_magick.rb file into your RAILS_ROOT/lib directory and add <require "mini-magick"> to RAILS_ROOT/config/environment.rb

MiniMagick does NOT require rails though. All the code you need to use MiniMagick is located in the mini_magick/lib/mini_magick.rb file.
