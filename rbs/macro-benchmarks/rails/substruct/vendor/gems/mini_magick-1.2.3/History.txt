== 1.2.2 / 2007-06-01

# 1.) all image commands return the image object (The output of the last command is saved in @output)
# 2.) identify doesn't trip over strangley named files
# 3.) TempFile uses file extention now (Thanks http://marsorange.com/archives/of-mogrify-ruby-tempfile-dynamic-class-definitions)
# 4.) identify commands escape output path correctly

== 1.2.3 / 2007-06-15

# 1.) Image::from_file doesn't drop the file extension anymore, it and use the image_temp_file correctly
# 4.) TempFiles are stored as an instance variable in Image instances so they don't get cleaned up prematurely via garbage collection
